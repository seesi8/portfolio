    "description" : " I wanted to start leaning react and how to start making more professional websites.I choose react for it's populatity and compatibility with many packages. I was also used to node.js at this point so I understood the way that a backend and frotend functioned together. After deciding that I wanted to use react I started looking for tutorials. I then diciden on fireship.io. There were many tutorials and all for a normal price. I started the tutorial there and fixed some bugs I experianced. The coolest part of the project was that is was a PWA. This means that is was able to run offile along with a bunch of other fetures. I was facinated by the idea of a website being able to run offile. I have tried to incorperate this into my projects ever since (Only when it made sence). Once I finished with the course I continued to edit the project, And I made it better. I changed up the styles and also fixed some bugs that were in the original code. It was a very fun project and it tought me the fundimentals of react and PWAs and i have used thoose same fundimentals ever sence",
