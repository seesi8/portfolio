    "description" : "I wanted to create a way to share my coding achievements. So I created a blog that way I could post different thanks I built. The blog was built using node.js and express to get data to the frontend and make it reactive. This worked well, but its not a perfect solution as it was hard to deploy and it was never finally pushed into production. I initially created it using mongo DB, but as it did not work out with deployment I had to switch over to using mySQL which not was not intended for this project as a relational database is a lot different than mongoDB. The main page looked nice and it was made using pure HTML and CSS and using express to make it reactive. This project taught me a lot about the deployment and production processes of what apps and how different products solutions work different ways. i used this later to create my portfolio which was the better version of this. I had done previous node.js stuff before so that is why I thought no Node.js would work, but in the end no Node.js did not turn out to be a good solution for the project because deploying it was expensive and required a lot of maintenance. I wanted to continue working on other projects and was looking for a solution that required less maintenance so that is why you cannot find a live demo and why the MySQL database is no longer existing. One of the problem I ran into was the Web hosting provider I was using the was not great for this type of application. It was hard getting SSL certification and it made it hard to push the app into deployment. I did lean alot about user authenitcation and encryption during this processes even if some of the backend security mesures were not all that secure.",

    "tldr" : "This Blog way made using node.js and exrpress. The frontend was made purely of html and css. This project was a big learning expreiance into the deployment of applications. The database i used at first was mongoDB, but after starting deployment I changed to MySQL. There is no liveDemo becuase the app was never deployed becasue of maintenance, cost, and secureity.",
