    "description" : " After finisheing ly react course I still felt like I did not fully understand the language. All of the react projects I had none were smaller and tought me fundimentals, but not much sytax. While fundimentals are important if I wanted to create a truly independant piece of code I would need to learn the syntax. Luckely the class i was taking had a next react firevase course. It was a blog. Much like the one I created earlier, but this one tought me better ways to write my code, and it allowed me to make this project one kf my favorite classes I had taken. It seemed like the next step to my previous project only this time I did not have much intention of using this project outside of using it as a learning opportunity. It worked building this website tought me what I needed to know and allowed my to build the portfolio website you are reading this on. ",
