  "tldr": "Because I played a lot of video games it seemed inevitable that I would want to code my own. I decided to make one of the type where you merge items to make it better and better forever. I decided that I would make it so that you would merge pigs and they would upgrade in ability. Some of the scripts I created included spawning scripts which generated a unique position in the board, merge scripts which searched for the next pigs in the prefab and spawned it, and a momentum script which made the pigs bounce around the scene. I finally wrote my own custom cross platform saving script so that the game would save between sessions. It taught me about the main ideas of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). Sadly I was not able to publish to iOS because of the Apple developer age restriction, so I published it to the web. It is not made for the web so it does not look great. Source code is a zip because of GitHub file size limit.",
