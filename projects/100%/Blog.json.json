  "tldr": "I wanted to create a way to share my coding achievements, so I created a blog so that I could post different things I built. The blog was built using Node.js and Express to get data to the frontend and make it reactive. The main page was made using pure HTML and CSS. I initially created it using MongoDB, but as it did not work out with deployment I had to switch over to using MySQL. This project taught me a lot about the deployment and production processes of apps and how different products and solutions work in different ways. I did learn a lot about user authentication and encryption during this process. There is no live demo because the app was never deployed because of maintenance, cost, and security."
