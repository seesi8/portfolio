  "tldr": "Hypixel Skyblock is a game which takes part in the Minecraft video game. This tool started as a part of a larger web app, which provided tools in order to help a user better manage their finances in game. The parent website no longer works, due to API updates, and my refusal to pay for a mySQL database. However, I was able to migrate this tool into a React App. This tool highlights my development in data management, and problem solving. This was one of the first web apps I never made. The app originally used barebones express, but is now migrated to react & Next JS."
