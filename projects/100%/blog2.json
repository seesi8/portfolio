  "tldr": "This was a blog I made following a tutorial. It teaches you about backend data structure, user authentication, and the right practices and security measures to make a fully functional blog. Some of the key features of this blog was the ability to authenticate users through Google using the Firebase authentication API. It also uses Firebase's Firestore database. It has the ability to have a paginated homepage with database cursors. It uses SEO features like metadata to make it search engine optimized. It also uses SSR (Server Side Rendering) and ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) to make a responsive website without it being as taxing as running it on client. I think that this was one of my biggest learning projects that I have ever done.",
