  "tldr": "After learning how to use React I wanted to build something that I could use. I realized that I needed a portfolio to showcase the rest of my projects. I started by building the user authentication, then moving onto the posts, then the contact page. Using React-Three-Fiber I created a revolving model of all of the technologies I had used along my coding journey. I spent time working on details such as adding a 3D text effect to the main headers and adding a timeline to fill up extra empty space. It is fully reactive to work on mobile and other small devices. It has a contact me page, posts projects, and even an interactive 3D model, all made with React. This project was very fun and useful.",
