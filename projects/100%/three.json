  "tldr": "I was browsing across YouTube when I came across a video by Firebase about how to make cool 3D backgrounds. In the tutorial it taught me the basics of how to set up a Three.js scene and what it took to make it. I learned about how to create scenes and work with lighting and cameras. I was able to take this skill and use it later in my portfolio. This project also let me figure out later the differences between Three.js and React-Three-Fiber. It was a fun project in which I learned about how 3D rendering works in JavaScript.",
