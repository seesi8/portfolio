  "tldr": "At the start of quarantine I started sitting at my computer a lot more, so I wanted a standing desk, but I didn't just want any standing desk. I wanted to build my own. I discovered linear actuators. I needed to build a table that could move up and down with strong thick moveable legs. At first, there was a polarity problem which caused it to not be able to be made with the current items. Later in 2022, I wanted to revisit the project because I needed the wiring experience. After buying some relays from the Micro Center and grabbing an Arduino I already had, I was ready to go. I wired it up so that the Arduino could control the two motors and their polarity. I then 3D printed a case for the whole thing and put it on the bottom of the desk. It worked. Source code is to the Arduino code and the live demo is to a YouTube video of it working.",
