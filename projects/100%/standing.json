    "description": "At the start of quarantine I started sitting at my computer a lot more (and coding a lot more), so I wanted a standing desk, but I didn't just want any standing desk. I wanted to build my own. I discovered linear actuators, so to my younger mind it seemed as easy as strapping two actuators to the side of a desk and adding power, but it was not that easy. For example, at first, I needed to build a table that could move up and down. Because I did not think that the actuators were not stable enough to support the table by themselves I needed strong thick moveable legs (which ended up being 100% necessary). I used the original legs for a table I had and strapped some cabinet sliders (to combine the two pieces while still making it able to move) to the side of the legs. I then made a wooden box that would fit outside of the legs. Finally, I screwed the cabinet sliders into the outside box. This made it so that the table could be lifted with my hands, but had no way to move automatically. I solved this with some linear actuators. I also bought a three-way switch, 12v AC to DC converter, and a speed controller because one of the motors was a lot faster than the other. The fact that one was faster than the other ended up being a super big problem because the speed controller could not have the input polarity reversed. The way I had the Wiring done the polarity was reversed before the speed controller. Which the speed controller would not allow. I also can't put the three-way switch after the speed controller because there are only two input terminals on the switch. The price for this was already getting high, so I did not want to buy a new speed controller. This caused me to take a break from the project for about two years, in that time I got a standing desk off of amazon. Later in 2022, I wanted to revisit the project not because I needed the desk, but because I needed the wiring experience. After buying some relays from the micro center and grabbing an Arduino I already had, I was ready to go. I wired it up so that the Arduino could control the two motors and their polarity. I then 3d printed a case for the whole thing and put it on the bottom of the desk. IT WORKED.",

    "tldr": "This standing desk was made over two years. At first, there was a polarity problem which caused it to not be able to be made with the current items. A year later I revisited the project and with the help of an Arduino and some two-channel relays, I was able to make a working standing desk. This was a very fun project during the end when I had gathered the knowledge I needed to complete the standing desk. Source code is to the Arduino code and the live demo is to a youtube video of it working.",
