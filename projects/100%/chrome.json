  "tldr": "This project was inspired by the book: The Pragmatic Programmer. I read about keeping a knowledge portfolio and I wanted a way to look back and relearn things. I chose to make a Chrome extension so that saving the data would be as convenient as possible. I used HTML injection to add a button to the bottom of pre-elements. I then used the data of that HTML element along with data from the Chrome API to create a POST request to my own Next.js API route which uploaded it to a database. This project taught me about the permissions that extensions have to the website and how to pass params back and forth depending on permissions.",
