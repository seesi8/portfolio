  "tldr": "As someone who is a large NBA fan, and who plays fantasy basketball, creating a tool to help me better manage my team seemed like a rational idea. This app is based atop the sleeper api, along with my Hashtag Basketballâ€™s player values. This project posed a challenge in terms of performance, as I found that in my first draft of the app loading times were extreme. However through a process primarily consisting of refactoring code in order to limit network requests, I was able to optimize the app. It uses React & Next JS as frameworks."
