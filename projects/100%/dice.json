  "tldr": "At the very start of the pandemic I started getting really into coding. The first project that started this journey was a dice probability calculator. I was playing DND and was amazed by how probability worked and how rolling dice probabilities worked. After reading about how probabilities worked I wanted an easy way to calculate them in my games of DND. This is not made to be fast, but it was programmed as a way for me to understand probability by calculating every single combination that could happen on the dice. It was a good starting project and taught me the fundamentals of coding and some math and probability.",
