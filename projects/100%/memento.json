  "tldr": "I wanted to start learning React and how to start making more professional websites. I chose React for its popularity and compatibility with many packages. This website is a PWA (Progressive Web App). The coolest part of the project was that it was able to run offline along with a bunch of other features. I was fascinated by the idea of a website being able to run offline. Once I finished with the course I continued to edit the project. I changed up the styles and also fixed some bugs that were in the original code. It was a very fun project and it taught me the fundamentals of React and PWAs and I have used those same fundamentals ever since. This project is a starting point for all of my other React projects.",
